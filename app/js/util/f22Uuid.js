  // 'RFC 4122 specifies an explicit ordering of the fields - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4122#section-4.1.2 - that puts the low bytes of the timestamp
  // at the front of the string. I forget the rational for this - something to do with putting the most-likely-to-change fields at the front of the
  // string to improve string comparison performance, iirc. If you want to sort by timestamp, you'll need to swap the 1st and 3rd fields (separated by '-'),
  // then order lexicographically.'
